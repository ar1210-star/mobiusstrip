Code Structure:
The code is organized using a clean, Object oriented approach with a class named MobiusStrip.
It encapsulates all functionality like generating,visualizing regarding the Mobiusstrip.

**init**(): Initializes the radius R, width w, and mesh density n. It generates the 2D parameter grid (u, v) using np.meshgrid and computes the (x, y, z) coordinates for the surface.

\_generate_mesh(): Uses the parametric equations:
x(u,v)=(R+v⋅cos(u/2))⋅cos(u)
y(u,v)=(R+v⋅cos(u/2))⋅sin(u)
z(u,v)=v⋅sin(u/2)
This produces a 3D mesh of points (X, Y, Z) representing the Mobius surface.

surface_area(): Numerically estimates the surface area using vector calculus and grid spacing.

edge_length(): Approximates the total length of the boundary (both edges) using Euclidean distances between adjacent points.

plot(): Visualizes the surface in 3D using matplotlib.

Surface Area approximation:
Partial derivatives with respect to u and v are estimated using np.gradient(...) and scaled by the grid step sizes du and dv.
The cross product of the derivatives gives the surface normal vector.
The magnitude of this vector at each point is the local surface element area.
Summing all these and multiplying by du \* dv gives the total surface area.

challenges faced:

1. Bit of complicated math but learned a new thing:
   Working with parametric equations, partial derivatives, and cross products initially felt mathematically intense. However, this challenge helped deepen my understanding of 3D surface modeling and vector calculus, especially in applying theoretical math using NumPy.

2. understanding and applying meshgrid properly:
   Figuring out how np.meshgrid works — especially the relationship between parameter directions (u, v) and array axes (axis=0, axis=1) — was initially confusing. It was essential to map the parameter space correctly to get a visually and mathematically accurate Möbius strip.

3. Surface area approximation using gradients:
   Approximating the surface area required a correct understanding of partial derivatives using np.gradient() and how to scale them using du and dv. Getting this wrong led to incorrect results or unrealistic area values initially.
